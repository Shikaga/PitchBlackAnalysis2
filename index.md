Antihero: Why the Riddick franchise doesn't understand itself
=============================================================

Introduction
============

*Pitch Black* is science-fiction horror film starring Vin Diesel. It has all the elements of a classic survival horror flick: A tough guy, a villain, lethal monsters and, of course, a disparate group of survivors waiting to be killed for the viewing pleasure of the audience. And, of course, above all this one element stands out in the film: the character of Richard B. Riddick.

But, while *Pitch Black* may have all the trappings of generic horror movie, it goes far beyond that, breaking the bounds of mediocrity and becoming, in my opinion at least, a near perfect film. 

And with a successful horror movie with a strong group of core fans, a sequel cannot be far behind. After all, there are a lot of similarities between *Pitch Black* and Ridley Scott's horror masterpiece, *Alien*. And James Cameron's sequel to *Alien*, *Aliens*, is an action movie triumph. Take your main character, throw them back into the fray in a larger story with more aliens and bigger explosions, complete with nukes from orbit, and you have motion picture gold. Surely the same will work for *Pitch Black*?

Sadly, this was not to be the destiny of the Riddick franchise. The ill conceived *Chronicles of Riddick*, failed so completely that it looked like it would tank the entire franchise. From the plot to the dialog, the editing and the special effects, not to mention the characters and villains, it is quite hard to say anything good about the film. There are perhaps a few good individual scenes, but I sure can't think of any right now.

Apparently the producers felt the same way, and it seemed like the Riddick franchise was dead in the water for the better part of a decade, at least as far the silver screen was concerned (it supposedly had a favourable run of attached video games, a rare occurance in a world of low budget video game cash ins). 

But Vin Diesel was not so easily deterred. Becoming an action movie star in the time since *Pitch Black*, thanks in large part to *The Fast and the Furious* sequels now going into their seventh incarnation, Vin Diesel sunk his own money into producing another sequel.

In the third film (fourth if you count the ???, an animated direct to DVD sequel set between the events of *Pitch Black* and *Chronicles*), simply called *Riddick*, Vin Diesel reprises his role in what is by and large a remake of first film. Gone is the convoluted world building and supernatural plot lines. The back to basics Riddick vs the Elements film tries to exploit what made *Pitch Black* so good, and while it doesn't quite stick the landing, it was a good effort. 

But why? What is it that makes *Pitch Black* so good, *Chronicles* so bad and *Riddick* mediocre at best?


Part 1: Hero
============

`"They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep. All but the primitive side. The animal side. No wonder I am still awake"`

Richard B. Riddick
------------------

To truly understand the Riddick franchise, we need understand its narrative core, namely, Richard B. Riddick

In the first twenty four words of the film, *Pitch Black* tells you more about its protagonist than most films do in their entire three acts. These lines hook the audiences attention immediately. Who is this character that is somehow unaffected by Cryosleep, who refers to himself as a wholly "primitive animal"?

A confessed murder, Riddick is a total badass. Muscled, bald, supremely competent and arrogant, he is the very definition of an action movie hero.

The alpha male sensibilities that Riddick exudes provide a great deal of wish fulfilment for men. He is simultaneously feared and idolised. When he talks people listen, and when he says jump, people ask how high. The audience watches his every move, and his "bad guy with a heart of gold", persona makes him almost impossible to predict, and we are constantly guessing what he is going to do next.

Most traditional protagonists will move heaven and earth, usually by some deus ex machina, to protect those in their care (usually a female love interest). A typical example of this "white knight cliche" would be an antagonist capturing the love interest, at which point the hero will drop their weapons, and allow themselves to get captured to save the one they love. Shortly after they will escape and save the day. We have all seen it a million times.

Riddick is not one of these protagonists. He does what he can to save the other crew members, but he is pragmatic, never expecting a deus ex machina to help him save everyone in the face of impossible odds. This realism combined with his bleak outlook on life, and of course standard action movie trappings of witty one liners and a never say die attitude, makes him interesting.

And so we, like Jack in the movie, fall into a sort of hero worship of Riddick. And yet this hero worship is the very downfall of Riddick franchise, for the writers of the *Chronicles of Riddick* likewise fell in love with their character. And not unlike the internet's Chuck Norris Facts, his actions became grander with every retelling. 

But before we start to talk about *Chronicles*, let us have a analyse the character of Riddick in *Pitch Black*.

Alpha Male
----------

At the start of *Pitch Black*, Riddick is presented to us as the salient threat, the antagonist of a would be slasher film. Between his opening monologue and Johns doomsaying, we are given the impression that Riddick is a death dealing machine, that wouldn’t hesitate to “skullfuck you in your sleep”, in Johns most eloquent words.

In the wake of the crash, while the crew search for water, Riddick stalks in the shadows. While he never "ghosts" any of the crew members, the way he behaves implies that he is invulnerable, as though there is nothing that these mere mortals can do to harm him. 

He sneaks up behind Fry and secretly steals some of her hair and then later happily returns to the ship and starts drinking their booze, while they stand just meters away.

However, a short time later, the passengers find Riddick standing over the missing body of one of their murdered acquaintances. Presuming that Riddick has started his killing spree, they tackle him to the ground and after a brief skirmish, capture him.

So it is at this moment in the film, twenty seven minutes into the film, that Riddick utters his first line of on screen dialogue. But this is also, where all of sudden his character changes completely.

I mentioned earlier that there are many similarities between *Pitch Black* and *Alien*. And indeed, there are. And if we are going to play with this analogy, then in this opening act, Riddick very much takes the role of the Xenomorph. 

Unquestionably dangerous, hiding in the shadows, attacking the crew members one by one while they hide in fear, Riddick is unquestioningly the Xenomorph of this first act. 

Yet at this point, the film suddenly turns into a more traditional survival movie. Riddick's role as "Big Bad", is suddenly taken out from under him, with the flock alien creatures that inhabit this planet becoming the crew's main threat.

And with the antagonist role taken, Riddick turns from the Jason or Freddy style killer to a sort of morally bankrupt guardian angel.

He quickly sets about devising a plan to get them all off the planet before the alien creatures rip them all to shreds. And, as though the aliens weren't bad enough, the group of survivors quickly start tearing themselves apart, with Riddick uncaringly pulling them along in his wake on his way to the escape ship.

But before we discuss the rest of the movie, let us have a look the twist in the movie where his character turned from antagonist to protagonist. 

Even in chains in Riddicks opening dialogue exchange with Fry he is clearly in control. Of course, he has somehow been captured, a grave error. But we have all been here before. The villain getting captured as part of his grand plan was a little less hackneyed in 2000, but has always been a classic trope of genre films, so we know that he will soon escape and start killing again.

And yet this twist never occurs. Getting captured never seems to have been part of Riddick's plan. Did he know that Johns would release him? Did he know that the only way that he would be able to get off the planet would be to travel with the rest of the passengers, allowing them to get picked off one by one, thus requiring him to get captured?

Indeed, it would not have been hard for to add a line of dialog for it to be so.

> RIDDICK: “Come on Carolyn. You think I helped you out of the goodness of my heart?” LAUGHS Fry shakes her head, visibly upset. 

> RIDDICK: “I couldn’t make it all the way myself, I needed a distraction. That’s all you were to me Fry. Big, fat, juicy distractions” SMILES EVILY

And yet, this never comes to pass. Riddicks role as antagonist truly does not outlive the first act. In fact, upon reflection, his actions of the first act are not conducive to an antagonist role when taken in context. Sure, he tried to incapacitate Johns in a bid to escape. But beyond that he doesn’t seem to bear any ill will to any of the crew members, even Johns.

His stalking of Fry seems to have been simply out of curiosity. He did not kill Zeke, which he was accused of. The film definitely tries to give you the sense of his danger in the first act, but upon a objective analysis, he never does.

We are informed by Johns that Riddick killed the pilot of his prison transport ship to escape. But we have no reason to believe that this is true. Johns, an already unreliable character, would have every reason in the world to lie about this to Fry.

Sure, Riddick admits to killing some people, but we have all seen *ConAir*, sometimes killing is justified, but the price must still be served.

But while Riddick may not be the villain of the piece, that is not to say that he is a saint. He tries to help the other passengers, but only to a degree. When one of the Imam’s boys gets cornered by one of the alien creatures, Riddick does not try to save him. He tells the boy to stay still, but when the boy runs, Riddick does nothing to intervene, clearly sensing the futility of trying to save boy.

This is not the behaviour of a normal protagonist. We need them to put their life on the line to protect the weak, we accept it as part of their hero's burden.

Yet despite the fact that Riddick often displaying cowardice and weakness, he still ends up being incredibly likeable. 

??? Tie these two paras together

It is because he performs acts that are unconscionable for a protagonist, that the audience finds him so interesting. He is able to make those choices that a hero cannot. 

Hypocrite
---------

However, there are times when, behind all the bravado and big words, the hypocritical side of Riddick can be seen.

For example, when Johns decides to sacrifice Jack to get the rest of the group to the ship, Riddick dispatches him. 

It is odd that Riddick so vehemently disagrees with Johns on this point. In a sense, as Johns explains, he *is* performing triage, letting one die so that the rest might live.

Yet shortly after this moral grandstanding, Riddick abandons all the survivors to escape by himself. Johns had told Riddick there was no way they could all get through, that they must sacrifice one of their number, and Riddick had clearly taken this as a unacceptable compromise.

But it is literally only a few minutes later that Riddick abandons them all to their fates and heads to safety. Perhaps he sees a difference between his decision and Johns.

One could conceive that their deaths were inevitable due to their own weakness, and that wasn't his problem, whereas Johns wanted him to kill an innocent girl to save his own life.

The question about the moral differences between causing a death by action and causing a death by inaction is one for a philosophy class, and I will not go into it here. Let's just say there are many viewpoints.

But as far as film logic goes, Riddick abandoning the survivors to their fate and Johns suggesting that they use one of the survivors for bait to save the others are equally reprehensible. 

And so this just ends up making Riddick seem like a hypocrite. So why is it that the audience forgives him for this? 

That is a difficult question to answer. And in reality, I think it largely due to the fact that we get distracted by the fact that the film switches to the character of Fry at that point in the film. The audience is too busy dealing with her story to truly analyse Riddick's behaviour in the context of his previous actions.

But even when analysing Riddick's actions objectively, it is difficult for us to criticise them. The fact is, we never quite lose the viewpoint of him being a villain. 

With all the things that he has done throughout the film, we never forget, that at the centre of everything, Riddick is a survivor. He has his own, perhaps selfish, code, that states that he will do whatever it takes to survive.

And the fact that he never apologises for that, provides him with the thinest of "moral codes", and the audience can't help but respect that. He tells Johns that he will come to regret not "ghosting", Riddick when he had the chance. And when Fry asks him to help him, he unapologetically states that `"You don't know anything about me. I will leave you here"`.

There is one thing that we can't stand, and that is betrayal. By being upfront and honest throughout about his villainy, we simply accept his actions. No matter how heinous a character might be, if they live by a code, we can forgive them. And so, in a sense, the survivors bring it on themselves. He warned them that he would betray them, and still they let him live and so Riddick is blameless for his actions.

The slipping mask
-----------------

So, Riddick is a villain, a ruthless killer, who cares only about his own survival. A stone cold badass, who leaves everyone in no doubt of his own selfishness.

Not quite. While a cursory glance of Riddick's character in may lead you to this conclusion, things are a lot more complicated than that.

For one thing, while Riddick tries at all times to play the part of a merciless convict, he isn't, at least not in *Pitch Black*. 

Throughout the film this mask slips, showing the weak, self doubting character beneath. While he tries not to let other see him in these moments of weaknesses, he doesn't always succeed, and the audience can tell.
 
He is prone to fits of anger. When Johns frees Riddick, he tells Riddick to `"remember this moment. The way it could have gone and didn't"`. Riddick is visibly annoyed, and lashes out. He snatches Johns' rifle from his hand, `"Fuck you!"`, he says threatening Johns, `"I want you to remember this moment"`.

Riddick should have kept his cool, graciously accepted Johns' phony treaty and waited his time, but instead he tries, unsuccesfully, to restore the balance of power in his favour, posturing that merely earns a grin from Johns.

He is clearly a troubled individual. He talks about his disdain for God, the long time he spent in prison and the fact that his mother supposedly abandoned him at birth, all pointing to a character who feels betrayed by life.

He harbours an emotional separation from the other characters, not empathising with them the way a normal protagonist would. 

Riddick shows variable loyalty the rest of the crew. He clearly fancies himself as a unapologetic badass, and tries to portray himself as such before the other characters. He delight's in their naiveté, and laughs at their collective misfortune.

His ire fall's most heavily on Abu, The Holy Man, with whom he has complicated relationship. Riddick sees his belief as a weakness. `"So where the hell's your God now?"`, he asks mockingly as the sudden rainfall starts to extinguish their last remaining torches.

But Riddick is not a sadist, nor without reason. He does try to get the entire crew to safety. He defends Jack against Johns, when Johns tries to betray her, and he continues to shepard them to safety.

The scene in which Fry arrives at the ship just in time to prevent Riddick from leaving without them is the emotional climax of the film. It is where, we finally see not only what Riddick is made of, buy also Fry, who I will talk about more later.

The scene sees each of them having made it to safety against incredible odds, and the prospect of going back for the remaining survivors suddenly seeming like an impossible task.

> `RIDDICK: "Strong survival instinct. I admire that in a woman"`

> `FRY: "I promised them, that we would go back with more light"`

> `RIDDICK: "Did you? Hmmm"`

> `FRY: "What? Are you afraid?"`

> `RIDDICK: "Me afraid?" LAUGHING`

But Riddick is afraid. He doesn't think that he can do it. He already abandoned them once, when he decided to leave them at the last mile. Riddick is not a villian, he did not string his fellow passengers only to abandon them out of some kind of sadistic game. He truly believed he was too weak to save them, and his own survival instinct made him take the pragmatic approach.

When Fry tries to convince him to save the others, he simply counters with offering to take her with him, knowing it would be suicide, and that Fry is too clever to do otherwise.

> `RIDDICK: "You don't know anything about me. I will leave you here"`

> `FRY: "I can't. I can't" CRYING`

> `RIDDICK: "Sure you can, here I will make it easy on you`

> `Riddick stretches out his hand`

> `RIDDICK: "Take my hand, Come on, Come one"`

> `RIDDICK: "Look, no one is going to blame you Carolyn"`

> `RIDDICK: "Come on, Come on, That's it, That's it. Good Girl"`

In this scene, Riddick is trying to get Carolyn to also take the cowards way out. He clearly thinks that if she too, abandons the others, then he is no more guilty than her.

He asks her to come aboard, offering his hand, and coaxing her onboard with gentle words and nudges, to overcome her emotional paralysis. This scene is truly incredible, Fry finally breaking down, weeping in the rain as she slowly resolves to leave the other to her face, while Riddick comforts her.

But at the last minute, Fry resolves to save others, even if it suicide.

> `FRY: "Now, you! You listen to me! I am the captain of this ship. And I am not leaving anyone on this rock"`

> `RIDDICK: "You would die for them?"`

> `FRY: "I would try for them"`

> `RIDDICK: "You didn't answer me"`

> `RIDDICK: "Yes I would Riddick, I would. I would die for them"`

> `Riddick takes off his goggles. A beat`

> `RIDDICK: "How interesting"`

It is in this moment that Riddick is most interesting. He has seen something that he can't explain. For Fry to selflessly go back for the others, even without Riddick's help, intrigues him.

But their journey is not yet over. They return and save the other crew members, but Riddick becomes separated from them, and is ambushed by two aliens. 

After their brief fight, Riddick is grievously hurt and alone, and Fry returns from the ship to save him.

> `FRY: "I said I would die for them. Not you"`

Fry helps Riddick back to his feet, but while helping him back to the ship, she dies herself.

It is difficult to know what the character of Riddick feels at this moment. 

At this point Riddick definitely sees a reflection of himself in Fry. The pragmatism, the cold exterior. And he can only take this as yet more evidence for his own belief that helping others only gets you killed.

And so while he may seem to blame himself, it is quite possible that he would let her take the blame for her own actions. He warned her of the dangers of such a selfless act, and she declared that she was willing to die for them.

He allows himself a moment to grieve, but once again, he tries to embody his persona of "stone cold killer", by the time that he once again joins the two remaining survivors. 

What his never-ending attempt to cling onto his mask says about his character, is as much a reflection of viewers feeling as Riddick's, but it is clear that he is not as unnaffected by her death as he tries to portray.

Killing Machine
---------------

In *Pitch Black* Riddick is frequently bested by the rest of crew. When he first escapes, John's is able to take him down, despite Riddick getting the drop on him (albeit, while shackled). And after he escapes, he is once again captured by crew, when they work together.

This kind of vulnerability is unusual for both a protagonist and antagonist alike. Heroes in genre films can usually take at least three direct hits from a grenade launcher before starting to bleed. To see a hero who is taken down with simply (???) swipes of a nightstick, is almost unheard of.

And not only is he physically weak, he does not have the usual prescience of a movie hero. He frequently misjudges both his enemies and his allies. When cornered by the creatures, he runs towards the rest of the crew, not predicting that they would instinctively shine light in his eyes. I have never seen such a trivial mistake made by a movie hero, and it imbues Riddick with a certain sense of believablity.

In addition, we can assume that John's was able to track down and capture Riddick by his skill as a bounty hunter. Johns does not seem particularly talented nor the "best tracker in the business".

We can therefore assume that while Riddick is obviously dangerous, as any escaped convict would be, there is no reason to believe that he is any more dangerous a prisoner than a bounty hunter would be expected to deal with on a daily basis.

In addition, Riddick tells us that he spent half his life in his previous "slam".  In fact, we are informed that he was only able to escape by hijacking a prison transport, we have no reason to believe that he is a man that no prison can hold. 

Cannon Fodder
-------------

Before we continue looking at Richard B. Riddick, let us take some time to consider the other characters in *Pitch Black*. 

Now, I have previously mentioned the similarities between *Alien* and *Pitch Black*. let us focus on that a bit closer. 

Both film's feature largely on female protagonists. Both movies involve getting stalked in the dark by aliens. Both movies feature largely civilian crew members. 

Consider:

In Alien, a [greedy crew member] brings a dangerous alien on board in an attempt to get rich. The Alien escapes, and then slowly hunts down each of the crew members in turn while the crew, headed by Ripley, try to track it down.

By contrast, in the first half of *Pitch Black*, John's brings a dangerous being on board in an attempt to get rich. Riddick escapes, and then (we are lead to believe) slowly hunts down each of the crew members in turn while the crew, led by Fry, try to track him down.

A forced analogy? Maybe. But as I have previously stated, in the first half of *Pitch Black*, before we truly understand the danger posed by the flying creatures, the audience is forced to see Riddick as the salient threat of the film.

Now, I have said that *Pitch Black* features a female protagonist. What, but I thought Riddick was the protagonist, I hear you say. Well yes, but let us take a minute and consider *Pitch Black* based on only the first 30 minutes.









The first act is unquestionably Carolyn Fry's movie. 

The film starts, with her waking up from cryosleep in the midst of a disaster. While her co-pilot Owens is still reeling from his sudden awakening, she is immediately into action, trying to land the ship.

She is then immediately confronted with an "action movie choice". With the ship crashing, she prepares to purge the passenger cabin. Owens talks her down, telling her that he has every confidence in her to be able to land the ship.

However, with ship still spinning out of control she attempts to purge the cabin anyway, but Owens has sabotaged the system, so that she is forced to try and land the ship intact.

It is at this point that we see the character Fry is, both in herself, and how she is reflected in Owens. She had the ability to land the ship, and Owens believes in her enough to entrust his own life into her hands. But she does not.

Is she merely being selfish, being willing to abandon people she doesn't know in a bid to save herself and her colleague? Perhaps, but she is also clearly pragmatic. In her mind, they are all going to die, and she is willing to make the sacrifices to save those she can. Hmm, now where have I heard this before?

This is often the kind of opening scene a movie would use to set up their main character. Perhaps this was a flashback, and she has since been rescued is now currently unable to forgive herself for trying to sacrifice all those people. One logical thing to do now, would be to cut to her waking up screaming in bed, before suddenly realising that she was just reliving her nightmare. Pan over to the futuristic alarm clock, showing that it is 3:34 in the morning, but never mind going back to sleep, Carolyn is going to wake up and brood. 

But fear not, soon an old friend calls her. They need a brilliant pilot. She says that she doesn't do that anymore. Ever since… "You can't blame yourself for that Carolyn, you did what you had to do." After a little bit of backstory, and perhaps a hint of past romance, she decides to at least listen to the offer. They get dinner in a shady diner with a shady backer, and after enough exposition, we are off on a good science fiction romp.

Instead, *Pitch Black* continues. Fry quickly assesses the damage, gathers to survivors and addresses the "Riddick problem". A lot of time is put into her emotion, and feelings at this point in the film. The guilt that she feels for Owens' death, not to mention trying to kill the rest of passengers.

She clearly doesn't have much motivation to do anything, but she still soldiers on, perhaps her military training kicking in. She organises the search for water and talks to Johns about the best way to deal with Riddick. She doesn't become overly demanding, or try and pull rank, and we genuinely like her.

In these ways she reminds me a lot of Ripley. Ripley is not the captain, nor is she a typical action hero. She is just someone who is trying to make their best of a bad situation.

Now, by this logic, opening narration aside, at the twenty seven minute mark, we could easily make the case that Fry is the protagonist of the film so far. And while Riddick takes over in the middle of the film, in a very real sense, it is Fry's arc that carries the most weight in the film.

In fact Riddick has so small a character arc that it is almost non-existent. By comparison, let us go back to climax that I mentioned earlier.

After Riddick's betrayal, Fry takes their last remaining light, and sprints into the night after him. Finally she confronts Riddick, and he tries to coax her onboard, to abandon the others and fly off with him.

Here, she is finally given her chance at redemption. Once again she has the option of either abandoning the others and saving her own life, or trusting in her own strength, and try to save them.

Throughout the movie, this has been main tension of the film. The conversation that she has with Johns earlier in the movie, where she explains that Owens was trying to prevent her from killing the passengers, is overheard by Riddick.

Her decision weighs on her, killing her inside with every second she spends with those that she tried to sacrifice to save her own life. She is clearly conflicted with her own demons, and it manifests in the way that she tries to take charge and get everyone to safety, in an attempt to receive absolution.

Riddick asking her to once again abandon them hits her like a hammer. The tension growing, beat by beat, with Riddick's smiling evilly as he sees her break down. But then, finally gathers her strength and throws it in his face, declaring that they are going back for the others, whether he likes it or not.

In fact, this reminds me a lot of the end of Die Hard. The Cop (???), midway through the film explains how after a shooting gone wrong, he had never been able to draw his gun again, and had been desk bound ever since.

Finally at the very end of the film, after the climax and celebrations have begun, he is finally able to shoot the one final terrorist. He is provided with an opportunity to put his mistake behind him, and reclaim his destiny.

Of course, by not living to the end of the movie, the sum total of the Fry storyline can only be so long. There is no way for her to be a part of any sequel, which is disappointing, because I think that her character would be very interesting to have seen in them.

She is a character that could have lead the entire movie, and perhaps even had her own franchise in a post *Alien* world, had the last five minutes gone a bit differently.

But, on the other hand, movies to seldom have the guts to deliver a truly devastating death, and I don't want to ever criticise one for doing so.

But Fry is not the only character of this piece. After the crash, the movie pauses long enough on the rest of the characters for us to get to like them. At this point in the movie, we are setting up for Friday 13th style slasher, and it is already clear that not everyone is going to make it off this planet.

But unlike most Friday 13th style movies, most of these characters are quite likeable and believable. Rather than thin stereotypes (???, The Jock, The Whore, The Clown and The Virgin, as so eloquently stated in *Cabin in the Woods*), we get well rounded characters, each with their own motivations and abilities. 

This is in many ways, what makes *Pitch Black* such a good movie. You actually want all these characters to survive. Sure, you came to the movie to see the awesome kills, and you want your money's worth, but humanising these people only helps the film.

Abu, the Imam, is one of the most interesting of the secondary characters. In addition to being one of the few people to survive to the end, his paternal care of his acolytes brings a sense of a family to the film, without needing the inevitable "father's vengeance". 

He clearly cares a lot for his kids, but trusts in his God as they slowly and mercilessly get killed one by one. Perhaps he sees himself as a Job figure, seeking meaning in his punishment. Perhaps not.

But it is also this religious aspect that adds a good deal of depth to the film. The Imam finds himself in the company of atheists, who gently discount his faith (???, Is this true?). 

But discussions of God with Riddick are some of the more interesting parts of the films. Indeed, Riddick claims to believe in some kind of God figure, laying much of his own troubles at his feet. Whether this is a true belief or merely social construct that Riddick uses to explain the bad things that happen in this world, is known only to him however.

But the Imam's constant faith is something that Riddick starts to disdain. For a character like Riddick to go as far as to disdain something, speaks volumes about his thought on the topic. As we have seen so many times before, Riddick hides behind his mask.

He insults the Imam, but as with his conversations with Fry, I believe that this is probably to do with his envy. He wishes that he could have the Imam's faith, but when he finds that it is not inside him, he lashes out, as we have seen him to so many times before.






 When the rain starts to fall, Riddick asks `"So where the hell's your God now?"`. But shortly after, when Carolyn convinces Riddick to save them, the Imam finally says, `"There is my my God, Mr Riddick"`, to which Riddick simply smiles in acknowledgement.

Yes, that sentence can be interpreted two ways, but I think it can simply be taken as the Imam trying to say that God has a plan for Riddick.

As they finally fly into the sunset, the Imam acknowledges, that `"There is so much prayer to make up for, I scarcely know where to begin"`, Jack replies, `"I know where I would start"`.

I never did really understand what Jack meant in this scene. The best I can guess is that she meant that she would thank God for Riddick, but if anyone has a better idea I would love to hear it.







This brings up the character of Jack. A young girl travelling alone, masquerading as a boy, she has apparently run away and is wandering through the galaxy.

Jack falls for Riddick's mystique almost immediately, quickly fashioning replicas of Riddick's trademark goggles, and running around the ship terrorising the rest of the crew, in the way on children can, until one passenger finally quips, `"Did you run away from your parents or did they run away from you?"`

Jack is very believable and never annoying as young characters in these movies so often are. 

In the scene where Riddick and Fry are talking about Zeke's disappearance, Jack enters and starts asking about Riddick's eyes. This is a wonderful bit of exposition, and a chance for Jack to show her fascination with Riddick, and the secret of his surgical shine job which is so poorly executed on in the following film.

Jack's gender is a secret kept from both the characters and the audience well into the film. When the crew must pass the most dangerous point in their journey Riddick halts the group, stating that it will be impossible to go any further, `"Especially with the girl bleeding."`





Jack also has a crucial role to play later in the film, where Johns decides to ask Riddick to "triage" Jack to save the rest of the group. Why precisely Johns would make this offer isn't exactly clear. Perhaps he doesn't understand Riddick very well. But Riddick quite clearly states that there is a line that he won't cross and Johns flew way over it.

After dispatching Johns, Riddick returns to the group, informing them of what happened. When Jack starts to get upset about losing him, Riddick simply says, `"Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare"`.

The other characters, while minor roles, are still very likeable. None of them really conform to typical stereotype roles, and they all have a little bit to contribute to the film. While inevitable, you do feel a little sorry for each of them as they are dispatched, albeit normally at their own hands for not doing as they are told.

ALL BELOW HERE IS ROUGH DRAFT





















Part 2: Villain
===============

And so, here we are, at the end of film. Riddick, Jack and Abu all fly into the sunset, to their next adventure (technically, (???), but, while I do like this movie quite a bit, the fact it is only 20 minutes long and animated, means I will not consider it canonical for this analysis).

 










Not only that, but he is beaten to the point of near unconciousness by a mere two creatures, who have already shown themselves to not be particularly dangerous, relatively speaking. He needs Fry to save him after his battle, and is so weak, that he is not even capable of saving her.

By contrast, the Riddick presented to us in *Chronicles*, is an unstoppable killing machine, who is able to take down crew after crew of highly skilled mercenaries unarmed, dangerous convicts with nothing more tin cup and necromancer Gods with a simple dagger.

He infiltrates Crematoria without any apparent doubt that not only he, but also Jack, will be able to subsequently break out.


This is sadly one of the common mistakes that all sequels seem to be prone to. Once your hero has defeated one enemy, they need to be given a bigger test. This is why a New York City cop who's initial actions are initially to call the police, is only three movies later blowing up a helicopter with a car and surfing a jet.

It seems impossible for films to let a character be anything less than a superhero by the time their second movie comes around. Even Alien is not completely immune to this, with with the Ripley from Aliens being significantly more badass than her previous incarnation.

That is not to say that the Riddick presented in *Pitch Black* is weak. He shows himself to be supremely competent, but he never quite stops being human. 











Part 2: Villain
---

A discussion about how the Riddick in *Pitch Black* is just as much a force of nature in the first film as the aliens that he dispatches. He is good because he is not in focus too much of the time, letting other characters largely carry the plot.


















Solution

A discussion about how a sequel to a movie like *Pitch Black* can best be executed. Can it?




How then, do you create a sequel to a movie like *Pitch Black*? Well it seems that Vin Diesel seems to think that you do it by remaking it within it's own continuity. And is he wrong?

Not really. Riddick is a good film, all things considered. It quickly jettison's the extraneous Necromonger plot lines alla Alien 3, and adds a family member bent on revenge for his family member that Riddick killed in the first film, alla Die Hard with a Vengeance.

The film is heavy handed in its use of repetition, both of plot points and shots. In many ways it is these scenes that are the best in the movie.

What about the "superhero effect"? Yes, it is there. The Riddicck in Riddick is significantly more powerful than his counterpart in *Pitch Black*. But it is not quite to the same degree that *Chronicles* go to. 

This Riddick can be hurt. He makes mistakes. He gets captured. And in the final "climax" of the film, he even needs too be saved by his enemies.

There are many problems with the "Riddick". For starters, the film really needs to have it's dialog almost completely rewritten from scratch.

In addition, non of the character's motivations make any sense. Every single one of the bounty hunters is supposedly here to kill Riddick, and yet they never do it, despite the many opportunities that they have.

The addition of the "cells" plotline goes a long way to fixing this issue. Obviously they cannot kill him once he has hidden the cells somewhere in the desert, but why does Johns save him at the end? He only moments before abandoned Riddick to take both power cells back to the ship, and yet something in the last half and hour or so has made him change his mind so that he now needs to save Riddick?



Why does thug number 1 suddenly attack Johns when Riddick is digging? Surely you would kill Riddick first, and why would you even try and kill Riddick? Every single person in the film who has crossed him so far has died! Leave him alone.




Also, unlike *Pitch Black*, nearly every single one of the characters is completely unlikable. One of *Pitch Black*'s strong points was the fact that most of the characters were actually quite likeable. None of the characters were over the top cliches. Even Johns, as flawed as he is, acted more like a scared chid than a action villain stereotype.

You genuinely want all the characters in *Pitch Black* to make it through. The same can not be said of Riddick. Every single one of the characters is completely unlikable.

You have absolutely no empathy for any of the characters that die, and no joy for those who live. In *Pitch Black*, when Jack and Abu escape the planet with Riddick, you feel genuinely relieved for them, and feel a very real sense of pain that Fry didn't make it.

You do not feel the least thing for these characters. They have all backstabbed and bitched and postured the whole movie, and you can't help but think the movie would be better without them.

In fact, have there ever been non-protagonist bounty hunters or mercenaries that the audience has ever empathised with? There is a whole sub population of society that the film industry has completely marginalised as evil greedy cannon fodder. I have known a few mercenaries in my time, and they have been lovely people, no worse than any national military solider. But while soldiers get to get shot holding a picture of their girlfriends while Adagio for Strings plays, mercenaries get gunned down with gleeful abandon, without ever a thought that perhaps this person was only on this job in an attempt to put food on table for their family.

Nevertheless, it is not the job of "Riddick" to try and reverse this trend. Simply be aware of it, and realise that the audience is not going to sympathise with mercenaries the way it is going to empathise with the survivors of the Hunter Gratzner.

And on the subject of empathising, a dog, seriously? Don't get me wrong, the dog was one of the better parts of the film. Firstly the, CG on it was excellent, about as good as I have seen. That said, it never stops being a CG dog. Vin Diesel is just able to act as though there is a real dog there. There is something about the way that people's eyes move when they are looking at a creature, that is completely lost, and just makes me feel like I am sitting on a sterile set whenever he and the dog are sharing a scene.

But anyone who has been around the film block for a while, could have told you that the dog was not long for this world. "Evil people kill dogs", is one of the biggest tropes in Hollywood, and it seems as though the film wants to villainise Santana much more for the killing of a dog who was attack him, than for the rape and murder of a woman at the beginning of the second act.


"Ball's deep"? What the fuck? Since when does a hero threaten a woman with rape? Okay, technically, all he implied was that he would have sex with her, not that it would it would be non-consensual. But the character was pre-established to be homosexual (which I will come back to later). To imply that Riddick's action's over the next twenty four hours would be such that she would change her sexual orientation, is simply adolescent male (read: Vin Diesel) wish fulfilment.

And why does her character even need to be a lesbian? It seems to me to be a real shame that it seems like no woman can possibly be tough in movies or television, without being a lesbian. This is not really the forum for this discussion, but seriously..

On the subject of homosexuality, I think it would have been much more interesting if it had turned out that John's had been John's husband rather than father.

Indeed, I though that the film was setting up for this. John's never implies that he is the father, Riddick induces it, and Johns never confirms nor denies it. Then later in the film, Riddick inform's Johns that his son was a junkie to which Johns Sr replies, "That is no the man I knew". Do father's refer to their son's as "the man I knew". Sure. But they are much more likely to say something like, "He was a good kid". This would have been a perfect juncture to reveal that Johns Sr was actually Johns husband.

The shock that your husband was a drug addict and you never knew about it, is so much more visceral than that your son is a drug addict. There are ten thousand movies about men's son's doing drugs and their father saying "you are going to ruin your life if you go down this path son".

But there are precious few films about how discovering that your partner is a drug addict can destroy your life. This would have been a far more interesting story. Firstly, it personalises the original Johns much more. You never think about the fact that he has a family or loved ones. It never occurs to you that he might be so viciously hunting Riddick's bounty because he has a husband to provide for

And I think that discovering that your Husband is was a drug addict is just so much more potent. Johns would have had to completely rethink their relationship. All those little things would suddenly start to make sense, as they always do. Ultimately it would make no difference, he would love him just as much.

finally, it would mean that the actor wouldn't look way to young to be Johns father. Ten years have passed since the events of *Pitch Black*. Taking that into account, Both Johns are about the same age, so I can only suppose that Johns Sr has had some serious work done. Perhaps he exchanged twenty menthol kools for a surgical face lift.
















CUT CONTENT BELOW

So it is not clear quite how dangerous Riddick is. In fact it is Johns who posses a far more salient threat to the survivors. 

Johns is selfish, with a morphine addiction to boot.  He was more than willing to kill Jack to save his own life, and he is fixing to betray Riddick from the moment that he frees him.




Who is the protagonist of this version?












Perhaps, all we need for someone to be a protagonist is for the audience to identify with them, to see the world from their point of view. Indeed, there are plenty of stories out there about anti-heroes, who we identify with and are undoubtedly the protagonists of their own films.

But can Riddick, who does not utter a single line of dialog for the first twenty seven minutes of the film, possibly be considered the film's protagonist? Is he the character that the audience most sympathise with?










It would not have been hard, for a writer to pick up the film after forty five minutes and turn it into a standard Freddy or Jason style slasher, with perhaps just one of the crew members escaping with the escape ship (with a cut of Riddick hiding in the engine bay for the stinger).









But this is not the direction the film chooses to take. It instead becomes much more interesting. Johns makes a deal with Riddick: help them, guide them, and he will get his freedom.

But before we discuss the rest of the film, let us look where we are after twenty seven minutes.





Indeed, despite the science fiction setting, flesh eating monsters and so forth, the action in Riddick actually is far more believable than almost any movie.

"It looks clear"





But then Fry's personal journey finally resolves. She determines that she would rather face death, even certain death, than leave any of her crew to die. She is able to rectify her mistake, to forgive herself for trying to purge the passenger hold



The first film, *Pitch Black*, is a film about survival, about many characters working together to survive the elements. In many ways, Riddick is just just one of those characters.

a character who never became much more than human. 

It is often difficult to consider *Pitch Black* as it's own film, so intertwined is the Riddick legend with sequels and video games. But even a person who has only watched *Pitch Black* will likely come out of the movie with the impression of "badass", on their minds, which is likely only going to grow over time.



But is this an accurate representation of Riddick, and is it the reason that *Pitch Black* is a good movie and Riddick a great character?









He is not necessarily main character, he doesn't even have the most screen time. 

But, by the end of the film, there is no doubt that Riddick is the hero of this piece. And it is upon this foundation that the Riddick franchise was built, including multiple films, video games and even anime.

But, while ostensibly Riddick may have escaped the planet at the end of *Pitch Black*, in many ways his character, his character never did. 


With his first line of dialog, Riddick steals the movie right from under her.








Can Hollywood create a trilogy about a character that is anything less than a superhero responsible for saving the universe?

Popular films leave their audiences with a deep seated affection for their heroes. A sequel is the natural way to capitalise on this. But a character needs a bigger challenge on their second visit to the silver screen, which must once again be amplified for the third. This continues until the once beloved character bears no longer resemblance to his earlier self (See Jason X aka Jason in Space). 

Die Hard came close. The first three Die Hard films remain within the bounds of reality. However, things swiftly go downhill with Die Hard 4.0 (Live Free or Die Hard), with the character of John McLain being almost unrecognisable, as he is soon blowing up helicopters with cars and surfing jets (seriously not making this up, watch the movie). By the fifth film, the character simply has no limits anymore.

And it is these limits, that form focus of our discussion.







Who is this character who then goes on to describe, with remarkable detail, right down to the leather tool belt, his fellow passengers, presumably by smell alone?

 John McClane, begins his narrative journey as a police officer and deadbeat husband, a believable everyman who is thrust into events beyond his control. But before long, John McClane turns into John Rambo on steroids. In many ways, the Die Hard series achieved more than most, it was actually capable of putting together a solid trilogy before succumbing to inevitable Hollywood money making machine. 


??? Move the rest of this down to somewhere more appropriate.

While I am personally not a fan of Die Hard 2, by and large it remains believable (relatively speaking), and apart from a bit of nudging the fourth wall ("Why does this keep happening to us?", "Not again"), the characters remain in their own world. Die Hard: With a Vengance, does a much better job. By losing the fourth wall and pairing John up with an entertaining sidekick, Die Hard 3 feels like a perfect sequel. John is no more powerful than he was in Die Hard one, and his motivation and circumstances are believable.

But in a way what is most tragic about Die Hard 4.0 is that it is actually a great movie. It would have fit in perfectly as a Brosnan era Bond film, or some equally slapstick action flick. But it is not a good Die Hard film, because the character has no limits.

Die Hard is supposed to be about about a New York Cop, doing the best he can in the situation. In Die Hard, when terrorists attack Nakatomi Plaza, his first action, is to run away from danger. He then tries to call the police; the phone lines are cut. He then pulls the fire alarm, and the call is diverted. He then takes down ONE terrorist, and uses his radio to call for help. Once police assistance arrives, he hides in the bathroom, until he suddenly realises that the roof has been rigged with explosives, forcing him to try to save hostages.

At every junction his choices are quite logical and believable for his character. And this continues, by and large, for the next two films. But soon Hollywood require another movie, to capitalise on a much loved character, and quickly start looking around the back shelves for an action movie plot. 

Any will do, with a flick of a red pen John McLain quickly becomes a protagonist, complete with catchphrase and references to previous films. The fact that his character has suddenly become superhuman badass is irrelevant.



Our story begins aboard the Hunter Gratzner, where Richard B. Riddick is being transported in cryosleep back to the prison by bounty hunter William Johns. After a midflight incident, the pilot Carolyn Fry crash lands the ship on a planet. Their ship is badly damaged, but the soon find another ship with which they can escape the planet. But their troubles are not yet over, as the planet is infested with dangerous flying creatures and it is up to Riddick, Fry, Johns and the rest of the passengers to escape.
